# Data Analysis

## Data Wrangling

1. **Loading the Dataset**  
   - The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.

2. **Handling Missing Values**  
   - Checked for missing or null values in columns such as `Branch`, `Gender`, `Product line`, etc. If any missing data were found, they were either imputed (e.g., with mean values for numeric columns or mode for categorical columns) or removed.

3. **Correcting Data Types**  
   - Ensured that data types for each column were appropriate, such as converting `Date` and `Time` to `datetime` objects for easier manipulation and calculations.

4. **Removing Duplicates**  
   - Any duplicate records, if found, were removed to ensure each transaction was unique.

5. **Tax and Total Calculation Check**  
   - Verified that the `Tax 5%` column correctly reflected 5% of the purchase `Total` and fixed any discrepancies in these calculations if needed.

6. **Outlier Detection**  
   - Identified and handled potential outliers in columns like `Unit price`, `Quantity`, and `Rating` that could skew analysis results.

7. **Standardizing Categorical Data**  
   - Ensured consistency in categorical columns such as  `Customer type` by correcting any inconsistencies or misspellings.

8. **Datetime Feature Engineering**  
   - Extracted useful features from the `Date` and `Time` columns, such as day of the week or time of day, for deeper analysis of sales patterns.
